# Point-E Installation and Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the code for generating 3d model from text.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- `git` (for cloning repositories)

---

## Steps for running LLama Mesh example
install transformers
```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
cd transformers
pip install .
```

run app.py
```bash
python app.py
```

## Installation Steps for point-e and shap-e models

### 1. Clone the Point-E Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/openai/point-e.git
cd point-e
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Point-E and Its Dependencies
Install the `point-e` package in editable mode along with its dependencies.
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 4. Install Additional Dependencies
The code in `point.ipynb` requires additional libraries for visualization and mesh processing:
```bash
pip install open3d trimesh
```

### 5. Clone the Shape-E Repository (Optional)
If you plan to use Shape-E models, clone the Shape-E repository and execute below commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/openai/shap-e.git
cd shap-e
pip install -e .
```

## Dependencies Overview

The following dependencies are required to run the code in `point.ipynb`:

### Core Dependencies
- `torch` (PyTorch)
- `tqdm` (Progress bar)
- `numpy` (Numerical computations)
- `matplotlib` (Plotting)
- `scikit-image` (Image processing)
- `scipy` (Scientific computations)
- `Pillow` (Image processing)
- `requests` (HTTP requests)
- `filelock` (File locking)
- `fire` (Command-line interface)
- `humanize` (Human-readable numbers)

### Visualization and Mesh Processing
- `open3d` (3D visualization and point cloud processing)
- `trimesh` (3D mesh processing)

### Additional Dependencies for CLIP
- `clip` (from OpenAI's CLIP repository)
- `ftfy` (Fixes text encoding issues)
- `regex` (Regular expressions)
- `torchvision` (PyTorch vision utilities)

---

## Running the Notebook

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook  # Install Jupyter Notebook if not already installed
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open `point.ipynb` and execute the cells sequentially.

---

## Notes

- Ensure that your system has a CUDA-compatible GPU for faster processing. The code will automatically detect and use the GPU if available.
- The generated point clouds and meshes will be saved as `.ply` and `.glb` files in the current directory.

---

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, ensure all dependencies are installed correctly. You can reinstall them using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
